Hey, I'm Jaycee! 

I'm a Staff Designer at GitHub so have moved over to @jayceeday. 

I have built: 
- [My Portfolio](https://jayceeday.com)
- [Moving to Vancouver](https://movingtovancouver.ca/)
- [Count Things - A Figma Plugin](https://[movingtovancouver.ca](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/934505788375924322/count-things)/)
